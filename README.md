# Web3 Fullstack Best Practices

### Macro Alignment, Micro Execution

Do small, reviewable, and digestible changes that align with the bigger picture of what your product is intending to do.

> Imagine all the future problems that may come and make sure you design it in such a way that it will be able to adapt to that change.

### Be Pragmatic

While we all have ideas of "IDEALISTIC" versions of our code, it is best to be pragmatic (practical) in your decision making. Make sure that you make decisions based on your context.

E.g. It would be nice to have all our code maintainable and have really small couplings, but for most timelines this is unrealistic. So in those cases it's okay to take on a little bit of tech debt to prioritize goals.

Balance Best Practices with Progress

# Common Best Practices

### Maintainability
- Easily changed without breaking anything
- Divided into small, digestible code (Don't need to read entire code base to be productive)

### Scalability
- Make sure it can be stretched to the needs of demand

### Readability

- The less someone has to re-read or try to understand your code, the faster teams can be productive.
- Should be easy for any engineer to improve and change
- Easy to follow flow
